## TL;DR: Front-Running & MEV in DeFi

- **MEV (Maximal Extractable Value)** is the "invisible tax" on DeFi users, bots and validators profit by reordering, inserting, or censoring transactions in the mempool.
- **Front-running, sandwich, and displacement attacks** are the most damaging for DEX users.
- **Mitigation is multi-layered:** Use slippage/deadline checks, commit-reveal schemes, batch auctions, private orderflow (Flashbots Protect), and intent-based systems ([CoW Protocol](https://cow.fi/)).
- **For devs:** Enforce slippage/deadline, consider commit-reveal for sensitive actions, explore intent-based architectures, and educate users on private RPCs.
- **For users:** Use wallets with private RPCs that offer **MEV-Share** (e.g., Flashbots Protect) to avoid the public mempool and even earn rebates.

## 1. What is MEV? Why Does It Matter for DEXs?

**Maximal Extractable Value (MEV)** is the extra value that can be captured by reordering, inserting, or censoring transactions in a block. In DEXs, this means bots and validators can profit at the expense of regular users (especially when trading large amounts or creating new pools).

**MEV Supply Chain:** The MEV ecosystem involves several actors:

- **Searchers:** Bots that scan the mempool for profitable opportunities and create transaction bundles.
- **Builders:** Aggregate bundles and user transactions to construct the most profitable block.
- **Validators (Proposers):** Choose which block to propose, often selecting the most profitable one.

This supply chain means MEV is not a bug, but a structural feature of transparent, permissionless blockchains (making mitigation a core design challenge for DEXs).

**Key MEV Attack Vectors:**

- **Front-running:** An attacker sees your pending trade and jumps ahead, profiting from the price move you create.
- **Sandwich attacks:** Your trade is sandwiched between a bot's buy and sell, extracting the maximum slippage you allow.
- **Displacement attacks:** An attacker preempts a unique action (like creating a new pool) with malicious parameters, causing you to lose value or fail.

**DEX Example:** Suppose you want to create a new liquidity pool with a fair initial price. An attacker sees your transaction in the mempool and quickly creates the pool first, but with malicious parameters (e.g., a skewed price). When your transaction executes, it interacts with the attacker's pool, causing you to lose value or receive fewer LP tokens.

## 2. How Do Front-Running & Sandwich Attacks Work?

### **Front-Running (Insertion Attack)**

1. Bot monitors the mempool for profitable trades (e.g., a large buy).
2. Bot submits the same trade with a higher gas fee, getting mined first.
3. Bot profits from the price change your trade causes.

### **Sandwich Attack**

1. Bot sees your swap with a slippage tolerance (e.g., 1%).
2. Bot buys before you, pushing the price up.
3. Your trade executes at a worse price (max slippage).
4. Bot sells after you, locking in profit (your loss is their gain).

![Sandwich Attack Example](/assets/guides/front-run-sandwich-attack.png)
_Figure: A sandwich attack sequence: bot buys before and sells after your trade, extracting value from your slippage._

### **Displacement Attack**

- Bot preempts a unique action (e.g., pool creation, NFT mint) with malicious parameters, causing your transaction to fail or be less valuable.

## 3. Core MEV Mitigation Strategies for DEX Builders

### **A. Slippage & Deadline Checks (Non-Negotiable!)**

- **Slippage:** Always require `amountOutMin` (or `amountInMax`) in swaps. Revert if the user gets a worse price.
- **Deadline:** Require a `deadline` parameter. Revert if the transaction is mined after this time.
- **Why:** These checks are your first line of defense (don't let users get sandwiched or stuck with stale trades).

**Solidity Example:**

```solidity
require(amounts[amounts.length - 1] >= amountOutMin, "Insufficient output amount");
require(block.timestamp <= deadline, "Transaction expired");
```

### **B. Commit-Reveal Schemes (Hide User Intent)**

- **How it works:** Users first submit a hash of their trade (commit), then later reveal the details (reveal). Bots can't front-run what they can't see.
- **Tradeoff:** Adds friction (2 transactions), but powerful for high-value or sensitive actions. Commit-reveal is best for actions where privacy is critical, but it can reduce UX for frequent trades.

**Solidity Example:**

```solidity
// Commit phase
function commitSwap(bytes32 commitment) external { ... }
// Reveal phase
function revealAndExecuteSwap(params, salt) external { ... }
```

_Figure: Commit-reveal scheme: users first commit a hash, then reveal trade details to prevent front-running._

### **C. Batch Auctions (Neutralize Ordering Attacks)**

- **How it works:** Collect trades over a period, then settle all at a uniform price. No advantage to being first (front-running and sandwiching are neutralized).
- **Tradeoff:** Complex to implement; often requires off-chain solvers (see [CoW Protocol](https://cow.fi/)). Batch auctions offer strong protection but fundamentally change the trading model and may not suit all DEXs.

### **D. Private Orderflow & MEV-Rebates (Flashbots, MEV Blocker)**

- **How it works:** Instead of broadcasting a transaction to the public mempool, users send it to a private relay. Beyond simply hiding transactions, modern relays can enable **MEV-Share**. This allows your transaction to be safely back-run by searchers who bid for the opportunity, and a portion of the MEV they generate is shared back with you as a rebate. You are protected from front-running and can even earn back some of your trading costs.
- **User Guide:**
  1. Add a Private RPC to MetaMask (examples: [Flashbots Protect](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-protect/overview) or [mevblocker.io](https://mevblocker.io/)):
     - Network Name: Flashbots Protect
     - RPC URL: `https://rpc.flashbots.net/fast`
     - Chain ID: 1
     - Currency Symbol: ETH
     - Block Explorer: `https://etherscan.io`
  2. Select this network before trading for MEV protection.
- **Bonus:** Failed transactions submitted via private relays don't cost gas! You might even receive an MEV rebate, turning a potential loss into a small gain.

### **E. Fair Sequencing Services (FSS) (Future/Protocol-Level)**

- **How it works:** Decentralized networks (e.g., [Chainlink FSS](https://blog.chain.link/chainlink-fair-sequencing-services-enabling-a-provably-fair-defi-ecosystem/)) fairly order transactions before block production. A core technology enabling this is the **encrypted mempool**, where transactions are submitted in an encrypted state and only decrypted after a final order has been established. This makes front-running impossible without relying on a centralized relay. Projects like **Shutter Network** are actively developing this tech.
- **MEV on Layer 2s:** On L2s, MEV presents a different challenge. Many L2s rely on a centralized sequencer, which can reorder or censor transactions without public competition. The long-term solution involves decentralizing sequencers or using models like based sequencing, where the underlying L1 helps guarantee a fair ordering, making FSS a critical component for the L2 future.
- **Status:** Still experimental, but promising for L2s and the future of Ethereum.

### **F. Adopting Intent-Based Architectures**

- **How it works:** This is a shift from imperative transactions (e.g., "swap X for Y on this DEX") to declarative **intents** (e.g., "I want to end up with at least Y tokens, and I'm willing to spend at most X tokens"). Users sign these intents, and a network of off-chain "solvers" competes to find the best possible way to execute them across any number of venues (DEXs, private liquidity, etc.).
- **Why it stops MEV:** The execution path is never broadcast to the public mempool, so there is nothing to front-run or sandwich. Solvers are responsible for execution and finding the best price. DEXs like [CoW Protocol](https://cow.fi/) are pioneers in this space, combining intents with batch auctions for powerful MEV protection.
- **The Future:** `transaction -> public mempool -> MEV risk` becomes `intent -> solver network -> optimized execution -> MEV protection`.

## 4. Developer Checklist: MEV-Resistant DEX

- [ ] **Slippage controls** (`amountOutMin`/`amountInMax`) enforced in every swap?
- [ ] **Deadline parameter** enforced in every state-changing function?
- [ ] **Displacement protection** for unique actions (e.g., pool creation)?
- [ ] **Commit-reveal** for high-value or sensitive user actions?
- [ ] **Reentrancy protection** (use `nonReentrant` for multi-token/external calls)?
- [ ] **User docs/UI** encourage private RPCs (Flashbots Protect)?
- [ ] **No on-chain randomness** (block.timestamp, block.number) for critical logic?
- [ ] **Security audit** before mainnet deployment?

## 5. User Tips: How to Avoid Getting Sandwiched

- **Use wallets with private RPCs** (e.g., Flashbots Protect, mevblocker.io) for all DEX trades.
- **Set tight slippage tolerances**, never use high slippage unless you understand the risk.
- **Check deadlines**, don't let transactions sit in the mempool.
- **Avoid trading illiquid pairs** since they're easier targets for MEV bots.
- **Stay informed**, follow DEX and wallet updates for new MEV protection features.

## 6. Summary: Building & Using MEV-Resistant DEXs

MEV is a fact of life in DeFi, but you can fight back. As a builder, enforce slippage/deadline, consider commit-reveal or batch auctions, and educate your users. As a user, use private RPCs and set tight slippage. Together, we can make the Dark Forest a little less dangerous.

**Mitigation Strategy Trade-offs:**

- **Slippage/Deadline:** Easy to implement, limits damage but doesn't prevent MEV.
- **Commit-Reveal:** Strong for privacy, but adds friction (2 transactions).
- **Batch Auctions:** Excellent protection, but complex and changes trading UX.
- **Private Orderflow:** Great for users, easy to adopt, but relies on external infrastructure.
- **FSS:** Theoretical, protocol-level fix.
