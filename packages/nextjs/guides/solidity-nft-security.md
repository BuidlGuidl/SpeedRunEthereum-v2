Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have exploded in popularity, representing billions of dollars in digital assets. However, with great value comes great risk. Smart contract vulnerabilities can lead to devastating losses for both creators and collectors. If you're developing NFT projects using Solidity, prioritizing security isn't just advisable—it's essential.

This guide outlines 10 crucial security best practices to help you protect your NFT smart contracts, minimize vulnerabilities, and build trust with your users. Whether you've just completed a [Simple NFT Example Challenge](/challenge/simple-nft-example) or are working on a complex collection, these principles will help you safeguard your digital creations.

## Quick Checklist

- ✅ Use audited libraries like OpenZeppelin
- ✅ Implement robust access control (Ownable, AccessControl)
- ✅ Guard against re-entrancy (ReentrancyGuard, Checks-Effects-Interactions)
- ✅ Use Solidity 0.8+ or SafeMath for overflows/underflows
- ✅ Test thoroughly (unit, edge, attack scenarios)
- ✅ Keep contract logic simple
- ✅ Never use `tx.origin` for authorization
- ✅ Avoid unbounded loops and manage gas
- ✅ Secure your metadata and `tokenURI`
- ✅ Get a professional security audit if your NFT is handling significant value or a large user base

## 1. Try to Use Audited Libraries like OpenZeppelin

Reinventing the wheel, especially for critical components like ERC721 token standards, is risky. [OpenZeppelin Contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/) provide battle-tested, community-vetted, and professionally audited implementations of ERC standards (including ERC721) and other common utilities.

**Why it's crucial:** Reduces the risk of introducing common vulnerabilities present in custom implementations.

**Action:** Inherit from OpenZeppelin's `ERC721.sol`, `ERC721URIStorage.sol`, or other relevant contracts for your NFT's core functionality.

---

## 2. Implement Robust Access Control

Not all functions in your NFT contract should be callable by everyone. Minting new tokens, pausing the contract, or changing metadata URIs are typically privileged actions.

**Why it's crucial:** Prevents unauthorized users from manipulating your NFT collection or draining funds.

**Action:**

- Use OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` contract for simple owner-only restrictions.
- For more complex scenarios, implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl.sol`. This allows you to define specific roles (e.g., `MINTER_ROLE`, `PAUSER_ROLE`) and grant them to different addresses.
- Apply the principle of least privilege: grant only the necessary permissions for each role or address.

---

## 3. Guard Against Re-entrancy Attacks

Re-entrancy is one of the most notorious smart contract vulnerabilities. It occurs when an external call from your contract back into your contract (or another contract that then calls back) happens before the initial function execution completes, potentially allowing an attacker to drain funds or manipulate state.

**Why it's crucial:** Can lead to complete loss of contract funds or unauthorized minting.

**Action:**

- Use OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard` modifier for functions that involve external calls or ETH transfers.
- Follow the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern:
  1. **Checks:** Perform all necessary condition checks (e.g., balance, permissions).
  2. **Effects:** Update the contract's state variables.
  3. **Interactions:** Make external calls to other contracts or send ETH.

## 4. Handle Integer Overflows and Underflows

Before Solidity version 0.8.0, arithmetic operations could wrap around if they exceeded the maximum value for a data type (overflow) or went below zero for unsigned integers (underflow). This could lead to unexpected behavior, such as minting an enormous number of tokens or incorrect balance calculations.

**Why it's crucial:** Can break your contract's logic and tokenomics.

**Action:**

- **Use Solidity 0.8.0 or later:** These versions have built-in overflow and underflow checks that will cause transactions to revert. This is the simplest and generally recommended approach.
- If using an older Solidity version, use OpenZeppelin's `SafeMath` library for all arithmetic operations.

---

## 5. Thoroughly Test Your Contracts

Comprehensive testing is non-negotiable. Your tests should cover normal functionality, edge cases, and potential attack scenarios.

**Why it's crucial:** Identifies bugs and vulnerabilities before deployment, when they are cheapest to fix.

**Action:**

- Write unit tests for every function in your contract.
- Aim for 100% line and branch coverage if possible.
- Simulate "minting out" scenarios to see how your contract behaves when the maximum supply is reached.
- Use development frameworks like Hardhat or Foundry, which offer robust testing capabilities.
- Consider mutation testing to assess the quality of your tests.

---

## 6. Keep Smart Contract Logic Simple

Complexity is the enemy of security. The more complex your smart contract, the larger the attack surface and the higher the likelihood of introducing bugs.

**Why it's crucial:** Simpler contracts are easier to audit, understand, and secure.

**Action:**

- Minimize on-chain logic. Offload complex computations or data storage to off-chain systems where appropriate, using the smart contract primarily for ownership and core interactions.
- Break down complex operations into smaller, manageable functions.
- Avoid overly complex loops or data structures that could lead to high gas costs or vulnerabilities.

---

## 7. Be Cautious with `tx.origin`

Using `tx.origin` for authorization is a known vulnerability. `tx.origin` refers to the original external account that initiated the transaction. If a user is tricked into calling a malicious intermediary contract, that intermediary contract can then call your contract, and `tx.origin` will still be the user's address, potentially bypassing your intended authorization checks.

**Why it's crucial:** Can lead to phishing-like attacks where users unknowingly authorize malicious actions.

**Action:** Use `msg.sender` for authorization, as `msg.sender` always refers to the immediate caller of your contract.

---

## 8. Manage Gas Limits and Loops Carefully

Ethereum transactions have gas limits. If a function consumes too much gas, the transaction will fail. Attackers can sometimes exploit this.

**Why it's crucial:** Poorly designed loops or gas-intensive operations can lead to Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerabilities or make your contract unusable.

**Action:**

- Avoid loops that iterate over unbounded arrays or mappings that can grow indefinitely (e.g., looping through all token holders). If iteration is necessary, implement pagination or allow users to process items in batches.
- Be mindful of gas costs for storage operations (SSTOREs), which are expensive. Minimize storage writes.
- Profile gas usage during testing using tools like `eth-gas-reporter`.

> **Real-World Example:** The Akutars NFT project suffered a smart contract bug that permanently locked over $34 million in ETH due to a faulty refund loop and logic error. This highlights the importance of careful gas management and contract logic. [Read more](https://nftnow.com/features/akutars-exploit-34-million-locked-in-smart-contract/).

## 9. Secure Your Metadata and tokenURI

While the token itself is on-chain, the metadata (name, image, attributes) is often stored off-chain and referenced by a `tokenURI`. If this URI points to a centralized server, the metadata can be changed or become unavailable, undermining the NFT's integrity.

**Why it's crucial:** Ensures the permanence and immutability of your NFT's characteristics.

**Action:**

- Host metadata on decentralized storage solutions like IPFS.
- Ensure the `tokenURI` construction logic in your smart contract is secure and cannot be easily manipulated to point to incorrect metadata.
- If metadata needs to be updatable, implement strict access controls for any functions that modify `tokenURI`s.

---

## 10. Get Professional Security Audits

Even with all best practices, subtle vulnerabilities can remain. For any NFT project handling significant value or a large user base, a professional security audit by a reputable firm is a critical investment.

**Why it's crucial:** Provides an expert, unbiased review of your code to identify potential security flaws that your team might have missed.

**Action:**

- Engage one or more experienced smart contract auditing firms.
- Provide them with clear documentation and your test suite.
- Address all findings from the audit report before deploying to mainnet.
- Consider bug bounty programs post-launch to incentivize ongoing security research.

## Conclusion: Security is an Ongoing Process

Securing your NFT smart contracts is not a one-time task but an ongoing commitment. By following these best practices, leveraging tools like OpenZeppelin, testing diligently, and seeking expert audits, you can significantly reduce the risk of vulnerabilities and build a safer, more trustworthy NFT ecosystem.
